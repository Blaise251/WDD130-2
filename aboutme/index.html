        I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for more than 20 years and the things I love about the Church is the continuous revelation we have through out Prophets and Apostles.
        I enjoy travelling to new places, meeting new people and during my leisure time, I love to rest. Hoping to learn from everyone. You can contact me on +233(0)599268087.
